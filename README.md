# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This is a team profile generator that creates a team of managers, engineers and interns. It is created by using the node index.js command within the terminal. After this command is entered, the terminal then prompts you a series of questions to create your team profile. After all questions have been asnwered, an index.html file is created with cards for each member of the team.
